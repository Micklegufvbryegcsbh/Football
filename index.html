    <h1>Football</h1>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Neymar</h2>
        <p>I like Neymar: he was voted the best footballer in Barcelona, ​​the best tricks, a beautiful haircut and a
            good salary, he likes to humiliate his opponents with his tricks and goals. Neymar is a football star but
            still hasn't received the Golden Ball </p>

        <h2>Barcelona</h2>
        <p>I like it because I love Spain, the best players played there: Messi, Neymar, Suarez and they won 3 cups this
            year</p>
